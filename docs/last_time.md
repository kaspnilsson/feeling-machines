# Last Session Summary

## Context
- **Repository:** Feeling Machines (Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)
- **Focus:** Reshape the frontend around a dual-surface experience (public gallery vs internal lab) and lay groundwork for richer storytelling and analytics.

## What It Was
- Single-layer routing with all pages under `app/` and a header linking to the old `/analytics` page.
- Home page led with raw batch listings; comparison detail rendered each run as an isolated card.
- Insights page was a basic sentiment grid without hooks for palette/materiality work.
- No scaffold for the internal admin/operations experience; navigation didn’t distinguish public vs. console needs.

## What It Is Now
- **Routing split:** Public routes live under `app/(public)` with a dedicated layout + header navigation; console routes sit in `app/(console)` and use a new `ConsoleShell` (responsive sidebar/top nav).
- **Shared primitives:** Added `PageShell`, `SectionHeading`, `MetricCard`, `InsightBadge`, shadcn table helper, and comparison-specific patterns (`GalleryHero`, `ComparisonStrip`, `ComparisonViewer`) to keep typography/spacing consistent.
- **Gallery landing:** New hero section contextualizes the experiment and provides CTAs; active comparisons are framed with `SectionHeading` and existing run cards.
- **Comparison report:** Detail view now uses `ComparisonViewer`—synchronized run selection, metadata badges, and thumbnail rail—plus metric cards for batch stats.
- **Insights dashboard:** Retains sentiment analytics and adds palette/materiality stub cards wired to accept future data output.
- **Lab console:** Scaffolded dashboard, batches, library, and analytics pages so internal tooling has a home once data hooks arrive.

## Why It Changed
- We need a compelling public gallery that spotlights finished work while still surfacing ongoing research; the hero/report layouts give visitors narrative context before diving into raw data.
- Separating public and console routes keeps most users focused on the gallery while giving the team a structured place for experiment management.
- Shared shadcn-based patterns reduce duplication and ensure every page—gallery or console—feels like part of the same design system.
- Palette/materiality placeholders align the UI with Phase 3 plans so analytics output can drop directly into the product when ready.

## Next Considerations
- Lock down `/console` behind auth and connect real Convex queries.
- Replace hero gradients with curated imagery and finish the comparison report reader interactions (zoom, split view variations).
- Feed live palette/materiality data, expand cultural reference modules, and continue refining console utilities (batch actions, run timeline).

> _Note:_ For now we are not wiring authentication or worrying about production-readiness of the Lab Console; it’s a research-only surface for internal use.
