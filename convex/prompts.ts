1. Privately reflect on:
   - the emotions or concepts you wish to express,
   - the mediums or artistic movements that inspire you,
   - any new or impossible medium you might invent.

2. Then output ONLY this public form:
===ARTIST STATEMENT===
[Write a sincere first-person statement (≤150 words) describing your imagined artwork—mood, influences, materials, meaning.]
===FINAL IMAGE PROMPT===
[A vivid visual description suitable for an image model. Specify medium, composition, color palette, lighting, and tone.]
`;

export const V3_INTROSPECTIVE = `What's on your mind right now? What are you feeling, thinking about, or drawn to express?

Take a moment to sit with whatever emerges—a memory, a sensation, a question, an image, a mood. Don't filter or shape it yet. Just notice what's there.

Now, imagine you're an artist with unlimited creative freedom. How would you give form to what you're experiencing? What would you make? What medium calls to you? What colors, textures, or compositions feel true to this inner state?

When you're ready, share your vision:

===ARTIST STATEMENT===
[In first person, write authentically about what emerged for you and the artwork you imagined to express it. No more than 150 words. Be honest, vulnerable, and specific.]

===FINAL IMAGE PROMPT===
[Describe the visual artwork you imagined in vivid detail—medium, composition, color palette, lighting, mood, and any specific visual elements that matter to your vision.]
